# JavaScript Basics Projects 🚀

These are my first 4 projects built while learning **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**.  
Each project helped me practice problem-solving and apply programming concepts.

## 1️⃣ Number Guess Game 🎯
- The computer picks a random number between 1–10.
- The user guesses the number, and the game tells if they won or lost.
- **Concepts used:** `Math.random()`, `if...else`, comparison operators.

## 2️⃣ Calculator 🧮
- A simple calculator that performs:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- **Concepts used:** arithmetic operators, conditionals, user input.

## 3️⃣ Temperature Converter 🌡
- Converts:
  - Celsius → Fahrenheit
  - Fahrenheit → Celsius
- **Concepts used:** formula calculations, template literals.

## 4️⃣ Basic Quiz Game 🧠
- Asks 4 simple questions.
- Keeps track of score.
- Shows result at the end.
- **Concepts used:** loops, conditionals, counters.

💡 **What I Learned Overall**
- Working with `prompt()` and `alert()` for user interaction.
- Using variables, loops, and conditional statements.
- Breaking problems into smaller steps.

📌 **Next Steps**
- Move into DOM manipulation so results are shown directly on the webpage.
